<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>A library implementing transducers &mdash; composable algorithmic
  transformations.  Scheme has many different ways of expressing
  transformations over different collection types, but they are all
  unique to whatever base type they work on.  This SRFI proposes a new
  construct, the transducer, that is oblivious to the context in which
  it is being used.</p>

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>

<p>Some of the most common operations used in the Scheme language are
    those transforming lists: <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>,
    <code>take</code> and so on.  They work well, are well understood,
    and are used daily by most Scheme programmers.  They are however not
    general because they only work on lists, and they do not compose
    very well since combining <code>N</code> of them builds <code>(- N
  1)</code> intermediate lists.</p>


<p>Transducers are oblivious to what kind of process they are used in,
  and are composable without building intermediate collections.  This
  means we can create a transducer that squares all even numbers:
  <code>(compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap (lambda (x) (* x x))))</code>
  and reuse it with lists, vectors, or in just about any context where
  data flows in one direction.  We could use it as a processing step
  for asynchronous channels, with an event framework as a
  pre-processing step, or even in lazy contexts where you pass a lazy
  collection and a transducer to a function and get a new lazy
  collection back.</p>

<p>The traditional Scheme approach of having collection-specific
  procedures is not changed.  We instead specify a general form of
  transformations that complement these procedures.  The benefits are
  obvious: We get a clear, well-understood way of describing common
  transformations in a way that is faster than just chaining the
  collection-specific counterparts.  Even for slower Schemes where the
  overhead of transducers is big, the effects on garbage collection
  times are often dramatic, making transducers very attractive.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>The sample implementation of transducers depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SRFI 9, <code>define-record-type</code> (included in R<sup>7</sup>RS
      small)</li>
  <li>SRFI-69 (hash-tables)</li>
  <li>Proper compose procedure (included if it is not available)</li>
  <li>A <code>vector-&gt;list</code> that behaves like in SRFI 43
      (included in R<sup>7</sup>RS small).</li></ul>

<h2 id="portability">Portability</h2>

<p>The sample implementation is easily portable to any
    R<sup>5</sup>RS/R<sup>6</sup>RS/R<sup>7</sup>RS-compatible Scheme.  The non-standard things are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <code>vector-&gt;list</code> that takes start and end
      arguments</li>
  <li>A hash-table implementation with support for arbitrary equality
      predicates</li>
  <li><code>case-lambda</code>, preferably efficiently
    implemented</li></ul>

<h1 id="general-discussion">General discussion</h1>

<h2 id="concept-reducers">Concept: Reducers</h2>

<p>The central part of transducers are 3-arity reducing functions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>()</code>: Produce an identity</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far</em><code>)</code>: completion.
      If you have nothing to do, then just return the result so far</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far input</em><code>)</code> do
      whatever you like to the input and produce a new
      <em>result-so-far</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of a summing <code>+</code> reducer, the reducer would
  produce, in arity order: <code>0</code>, <em>result-so-far</em>,
  (<code>+</code> <em>result-so-far input</em>).  This happens to be
    exactly what the regular <code>+</code> does.</p>

<h2 id="concept-transducers">Concept: Transducers</h2>

<p>A transducer is a one-arity function that takes a reducer and produces a
  reducing function that behaves as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>()</code>: calls <em>reducer</em> with no arguments
    (producing its identity)</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far</em><code>)</code>: Maybe
    transform the <em>result-so-far</em> and call <em>reducer</em>
  with it.</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far input</em><code>)</code> Maybe
    do something to <em>input</em> and maybe call the reducer with
    <em>result-so-far</em> and the maybe-transformed
    <em>input</em>.</li></ul>


<p> A simple example is as following: <code>(list-transduce (tfilter
  odd?) + '(1 2 3 4 5))</code>.  This first returns a transducer
    filtering all odd elements, then it runs <code>+</code> without
    arguments to retrieve its identity.  It then starts the transduction
    by passing + to the transducer returned by <code>(tfilter
  odd?)</code> which returns a reducing function.  It works not unlike
    <code>reduce</code> from SRFI 1, but also checks whether one of the
    intermediate transducers returns a &quot;reduced&quot; value
    (implemented as a SRFI 9 record), which means the reduction finished
    early.</p>

<p>Because transducers compose and the final reduction is only
    executed in the last step, composed transducers will not build any
    intermediate result or collections.  Although the normal way of
    thinking about application of composed functions is right to left,
    due to how the transduction is built it is applied left to
    right.  <code>(compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap sqrt))</code> will
    create a transducer that first filters out any odd values and then
    computes the square root of the rest.</p>

<h2 id="state">State</h2>

<p> Even though transducers appear to be somewhat of a generalisation
    of <code>map</code> and friends, this is not really true.  Since
    transducers don't know in which context they are being used, some
    transducers must keep state where their collection-specific
    counterparts do not.  This SRFI requires some transducers to be
    stateless (as is stated in the documentation of each transducer),
    but many are allowed to keep state. How state is kept is not
    specified. The sample implementation uses mutable values in
    closures, which is efficient and portable, but has all the problems
    of hidden mutable state.</p>


<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>

<p>Transducers and procedures that return transducers all have names
  starting with t.  Reducing functions that are supposed to be used at
  the end of a transduction all start with r.  Some reducers are just
  straight-up reducers, whereas others, like <code>rany</code> and
  <code>revery</code>, are procedures that return reducers.</p>

<h2 id="scope-considerations">Scope considerations</h2>

<p>The procedures specified here are only for the collections defined
   in R<sup>7</sup>RS small.  They could easily be extended to support
   R<sup>7</sup>RS large red docket, but specifying that would require
   conforming implementations to also support a substantial part of the
   red docket.  I therefore leave transduce unspecified for many data
   types.  It is however encouraged to add [datatype]-transduce for
   whatever types your Scheme supports.  Adding support for the
   collections of the R<sup>7</sup>RS red docket (sets, hash-tables,
   ilists, rlists, ideque, texts, lseqs, streams and list-queues) is
   trivial.</p>


<h2 id="lazy-eager">Eager or lazy semantics</h2>

<p> There is some overlap in the use case of transducers and lazy constructs
    like generators or streams. One big benefit is that you can compose
    transformations without building unnecessary intermediate state. There
    are, however, differences. Laziness is usually described as having "pull"
    semantics, i.e: you pull values through a pipeline of lazy constructs,
    transforming and filtering them on the way. This way you get only what
    you need.
</p>


<p> Transducers, being oblivious to context, are neither eager nor lazy, but are
    generally meant for eager contexts. The transduce form is always eager, and
    any general lazy application of transducers is outside the scope of this SRFI.

<h2 id="applying-transducers">Applying transducers</h2>

<h3 id="list-transduce">list-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(list-transduce</code> <em>xform f lst</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(list-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity lst</em><code>)</code></p>

<p> Initializes the transducer <em>xform</em> by passing the reducer <em>f</em>
    to it.  If no identity is provided, <em>f</em> is run without
    arguments to return the reducer identity.  It then reduces over
    <em>lst</em> using the identity as the seed.</p>

<p> If one of the transducers finishes early (such as <code>ttake</code> or <code>tdrop</code>),
    it communicates this by returning a reduced value, which in the
    sample implementation is just a value wrapped in a SRFI 9 record
    type named &quot;reduced&quot;.  If such a value is returned by the
    transducer, <code>list-transduce</code> must stop execution and
    return an unreduced value immediately.</p>


<h3 id="vector-transduce">vector-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(vector-transduce</code> <em>xform f vec</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(vector-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity vec</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Same as <code>list-transduce</code>, but reduces over a vector instead of a list.</p>


<h3 id="string-transduce">string-transduce</h3>
<p><code>(string-transduce</code> <em>xform f str</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(string-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity str</em><code>)</code></p>

<p><code>(port-transduce</code> <em>xform f reader</em><code>)</code>
   <br />
   <code>(port-transduce</code> <em>xform f reader port</em><code>)</code>
   <br />
   <code>(port-transduce</code> <em>xform f init reader port</em><code>)</code></p>

<p> If <em>port</em> is provided, it applies <code>(xform f)</code> to every value
    produced by <code>(reader port)</code> until the EOF object is returned.
    If <em>port</em> is not provided, it calls <em>reader</em> without arguments until
    the EOF object is returned.
</p>

<p><code>(port-transduce (tfilter odd?) rcons read (open-input-string "1 2 3 4"))</code>
    =&gt; (1 3)</p>

<p> Same as <code>list-transduce</code>, but for srfi-158-styled generators.</p>


<h2 id="reducers">Reducers</h2>

<h3 id="rcons"><code>rcons</code></h3>
<p>a simple consing reducer.  When called without values, it returns
    its identity, '().  With one value, which will be a list, it
    reverses the list.  When called with two values, it conses the
    second value to the first.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) rcons (list 0 1 2 3))</code> =&gt; <code>(1 2 3 4)</code></p>


<h3 id="reverse-rcons"><code>reverse-rcons</code></h3>
<p>same as <code>rcons</code>, but leaves the values in their reversed order.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) reverse-rcons (list 0 1 2 3))</code> =&gt; <code>(4 3 2
  1)</code></p>

<h3 id="rany-pred"><code>(rany</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The reducer version of <code>any</code>.  Returns <code>(reduced
  (pred? value))</code> if any <code>(pred? value)</code> returns
    non-<code>#f</code>.  The identity is <code>#f</code>.</p>

  <code>(list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (rany odd?) (list 1 3
  4 5))</code> =&gt; <code>#t</code></p>


<h3 id="revery-pred"><code>(revery</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The reducer version of <code>every</code>.  Stops the transduction
    and returns <code>(reduced #f)</code> if any <code>(pred?
  value)</code> returns <code>#f</code>.  If every <code>(pred?
  value)</code> returns true, it returns the result of the last
    invocation of <code>(pred?  value)</code>. The identity is
    <code>#t</code>.</p>

<p><pre>(list-transduce
  (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
  (revery (lambda (v) (if (odd? v) v #f)))
  (list 2 4 6))</pre> =&gt; <code>7</code>
  <br />
  <br />
  <code>(list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) (revery odd?) (list 2 4 5 6))</code> =&gt; <code>#f</code></p>


<h3 id="rcount"><code>rcount</code></h3>
<p>A simple counting reducer.  Counts the values that pass through the
  transduction.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce (tfilter odd?) rcount (list 1 2 3 4))</code> =&gt; <code>2.</code></p>


<h2 id="transducers">Transducers</h2>

<h3 id="tmap-proc"><code>(tmap</code> <em>proc</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that applies <em>proc</em> to all values.  Must be
  stateless.</p>


<h3 id="tfilter-pred"><code>(tfilter</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that removes values for which <em>pred?</em> returns
  <code>#f</code>.  Must be stateless.</p>


<h3 id="tremove-pred"><code>(tremove</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that removes values for which <em>pred?</em> returns
    non-<code>#f</code>. Must be stateless.</p>


<h3 id="tfilter-map-proc"><code>(tfilter-map</code> <em>proc</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>The same as <code>(compose (tmap proc) (tfilter values))</code>.
    Must be stateless.</p>


<h3 id="treplace-mapping"><code>(treplace</code> <em>mapping</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>The argument <em>mapping</em> is an association list (using <code>equal?</code>
    to compare keys), a hash-table, a one-argument procedure taking
    one argument and either producing that same argument or a
    replacement value, or another implementation-defined mapping
    object.</p>

<p>Returns a transducer which checks for the presence of any value passed through it in
    <em>mapping</em>.  If a mapping is found, the value of that mapping is
    returned, otherwise it just returns the original value.</p>

<p>Must not keep any internal state.  Modifying the mapping while it's
    in use by <code>treplace</code> is an error.</p>


<h3 id="tdrop-n"><code>(tdrop</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that discards the first <em>n</em> values.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="ttake-n"><code>(ttake</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that discards all values and stops the
  transduction after the first <em>n</em> values have been let through.  Any
  subsequent values are ignored.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tdrop-while-pred"><code>(tdrop-while</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that discards the the first values for which
  <em>pred?</em> returns true.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="ttake-while-pred"><code>(ttake-while</code> <em>pred?</em> <em>[retf]</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that stops the transduction after <em>pred?</em>
  has returned <code>#f</code>.  Any subsequent values are ignored and
  the last successful value is returned. <code>retf</code> is a function that gets called whenever
  <em>pred?</em> returns false. The arguments passed are the result so far and the input for which
  <em>pred?</em> returns <code>#f</code>. The default function is
  <code>(lambda (result input) result)</code></p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tconcatenate"><code>tconcatenate</code></h3>
<p><code>tconcatenate</code> <strong>is</strong> a transducer that
    concatenates the content of each value (that must be a list) into
    the reduction.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce tconcatenate rcons '((1 2) (3 4 5) (6 (7 8) 9)))</code>
  =&gt;
    <code>(1 2 3 4 5 6 (7 8) 9)</code></p>


<h3 id="tappend-map-proc"><code>(tappend-map</code> <em>proc</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>The same as <code>(compose (tmap proc) tconcatenate)</code>.</p>


<h3 id="tflatten"><code>tflatten</code></h3>
<p><code>tflatten</code> <strong>is</strong> a transducer that flattens an input
    consisting of lists.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce tflatten rcons '((1 2) 3 (4 (5 6) 7 8) 9)</code> =&gt;
    <code>(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)</code></p>



<h3 id="tdelete-neighbor-duplicates"><code>(tdelete-neighbor-duplicates <em>[equality-predicate]</em>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that removes any directly following duplicate
  elements. The default <em>equality-predicate</em> is <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tremove-duplicates"><code>(tdelete-duplicates <em>[equality-predicate]</em>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that removes any subsequent duplicate elements compared using
  <em>equality-predicate</em>. If the underlying data structure used for detecting duplicates
  can't handle arbitrary equality predicates, it should at least support
  <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code> and <code>equal?</code>. The default <em>equality-predicate</em>
  is <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tsegment"><code>(tsegment</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that groups <em>n</em> inputs in lists of
    <em>n</em> elements.  When the transduction stops, it flushes any
    remaining collection, even if it contains fewer than <em>n</em>
    elements.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tpartition-pred"><code>(tpartition</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that groups inputs in lists by whenever
  <code>(</code><em>pred? input</em><code>)</code> changes value.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="tadd-between-value"><code>(tadd-between </code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer which interposes <em>value</em> between each
    value and the next. This does not compose gracefully with
    transducers like <code>ttake</code>, as you might end up ending the
    transduction on <em>value</em>.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>



<h3 id="tenumerate-start"><code>(tenumerate</code> <em>[start]</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Returns a transducer that indexes values passed through it,
    starting at <em>start</em>, which defaults to 0.  The indexing is done
    through <code>cons</code> pairs like <code>(</code><em>index</em>
    <code>.</code> <em>input</em><code>)</code>.</p>

<p> <code>(list-transduce (tenumerate 1) rcons (list 'first 'second 'third))</code>  =&gt;
    <code> ((1 . first) (2 . second) (3 . third))</code></p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tlog-logger"><code>(tlog</code> <em>[logger]</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that can be used to log or print values and
  results.  The result of the logger procedure is discarded.  The
    default logger is <code>(lambda (result input) (write input) (newline))</code>.</p>


<h2 id="helpers">Helper functions for writing transducers</h2>

<p>These functions are in the <code>(srfi 171 meta)</code> module and are only usable
    when you want to write your own transducers. </p>


<h3 id="reduced"><code>(reduced</code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Wraps a value in a <code>&lt;reduced&gt;</code> container, signalling that the
    reduction should stop.</p>


<h3 id="reducedp"><code>(reduced?</code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>value</em> is <code>reduced</code>.</p>


<h3 id="unreduce"><code>(unreduce</code> <em>reduced-container</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Returns the value in <em>reduced-container</em>.</p>


<h3 id="ensure-reduced"><code>(ensure-reduced</code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Wraps <em>value</em> in a reduced container if it is not already reduced.</p>


<h3 id="preserving-reduced"><code>(preserving-reduced</code> <em>reducer</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Wraps <em>reducer</em> in another reducer that encapsulates any
    returned reduced value in another reduced container. This is useful
    in places where you re-use a reducer with
    <em>[collection]-reduce</em>. If the reducer returns a reduced
    value, <em>[collection]-reduce</em> unwraps it. Unless handled, this
    leads to the reduction continuing.  </p>


<h3 id="list-reduce"><code>(list-reduce</code> <em>f identity lst</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The reducing function used internally by <code>list-transduce</code>. <em>f</em> is reducer
    as returned by a transducer. <em>identity</em> is the identity (sometimes called "seed") of
    the reduction. <em>lst</em> is a list. If the <em>f</em> returns a reduced value, the reduction
    stops immediately and the unreduced value is returned.</p>



<h3 id="vector-reduce"><code>(vector-reduce</code> <em> f identity vec</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The vector version of <code>list-reduce</code>.</p>


<h3 id="string-reduce"><code>(string-reduce</code> <em> f identity str</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The string version of <code>list-reduce</code>.</p>


<h3 id="bytevector-u8-reduce"><code>(bytevector-u8-reduce</code> <em> f identity bv</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The bytevector-u8 version of <code>list-reduce</code>.</p>


<h3 id="port-reduce"><code>(port-reduce</code> <em> f identity reader port</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The port version of <code>list-reducer</code>.  It reduces over <em>port</em> using
    <em>reader</em> until <em>reader</em> returns the EOF object.</p>


<h3 id="generator-reduce"><code>(generator-reduce</code> <em> f identity gen</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The port version of <code>list-reducer</code>.  It reduces over <em>gen</em> until it returns
     the EOF object</p>


<h1 id="sample-implementation">Sample implementation</h1>

<p> The sample implementation is written in Guile, but should be
    straightforward to port since it uses no Guile-specific features
    apart from Guile's hash-table implementation.  It is written for
    clarity over speed, but should be plenty fast anyway.
    The low-hanging fruit for optimization is to replace the composed
    transducers (such as <code>tappend-map</code> and <code>tfilter-map</code>)
    with non-composed implementations.</p>

<p> Another optimization would be to return whether or not a reducer
    can return a reduced value, thus allowing <em>[collection]-reduce</em> to
    avoid checking for reduced values, however this would break compatibility
    with the sample implementation.</p>


<h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p> First of all, this would not have been done without Rich Hickey, who
    introduced transducers into Clojure.  His talks were important for me
    to grasp the basics of transducers.  Then I would like to thank large
    parts of the Clojure community for also struggling with
    understanding transducers.  The amount of material produced
    explaining them in general, and Clojure's implementation
    specifically, has been instrumental in letting me make this a
    clean-room implementation.</p>

<p> In the same vein, I would like to direct a thank-you to Juanpe Bolivar, who
    implemented pure transducers for C++ (in the Atria library) and did a
    wonderful presentation about them.</p>

<p> I would also like to thank John Cowan, Duy Nguyen and Lassi Kortela for
    their input during the SRFI process. </p>

<p>Lastly I would like to thank Arthur Gleckler, who showed interest in
  my implementation of transducers and convinced me to make this SRFI.</p>
